Are Genetically Modified Foods Safe
As the name would suggest, genetically modified foods that have been modified at a genetic level – having had their DNA modified to benefit the grower of the food in some way. For example, some GMOs (an acronym given to these genetically modified foods) are made to be more resistance to diseases or pests, some are made to require less water. For the farmers growing these foods, GMOs save money and ultimately lower the price of the crop. The opportunity to obtain food for a far lower price than before, and the fact that according to numerous studies GMO foods have been shown to have minimal adverse side effects, renders them a safe and necessary part of our society.
Since GMO foods have first been cultivated, people have been questioning the health side effects of eating GMO foods and feeding them to our livestock from which we get meat that we eat. Today, it would be hard to avoid GMO foods since so many foods we eat have been genetically modified. Many organizations are very against GMO foods while others are all for it. A simple Google search of GMO foods will bring up controversy over the safety of these foods. Some scientific studies show very adverse side effects including allergies and different types of cancer while other equally reputable studies will show absolutely no problems with the foods. For this argument, I have chosen a fairly reputable news source – Forbes – which published an article written by Jon Entine entitled: “The Debate About GMO Safety Is Over, Thanks To A New Trillion-Meal Study.” In this article the author concludes, in line with my own opinion, that GMO foods are a safe, non-harmful, cheaper substitute to the food’s non-modified cousins.
In this article, the author Jon Entine presents evidence discrediting some of those who oppose GMO food. Entine talks about some of the studies conducted that show that these modified foods have harmed lab animals, he writes about one of these studies conducted by one Gilles-Eric Séralini who found that “rats fed genetically engineered corn developed grotesque cancerous tumors.” However, Séralini was forced to retract his GM corn study and later published it as a non-peer reviewed paper. The process of peer reviewing an article ensures that the article holds some legitimacy in the scientific community – if other scientists can replicate or confirm the findings of the study then it can be published as peer reviewed. So, if a paper cannot be peer reviewed, it has not been scientifically confirmed and should not be taken as legitimate. In addition to attacking Séralini’s argument, Entine also makes claims against other studies and scientist who have spoken out against GMO foods. Furthermore, his article subtly delegitimizes the American Academy of Environmental Medicine (AAEM) by discrediting what they believe in. The AAEM is a group that rejects GMOs but they are also against the use of vaccines, and have papers on the their website claiming that WIFI causes illness in children exposed to it – both of which are ludicrous claims in my mind and delegitimizes any claim that the AAEM makes. In addition to claiming people and groups that are opposed to GM foods should not be taken seriously from a scientific perspective, Jon Entine also refers to multiple peer reviewed and repeated studies that show that “GM feed is safe and nutritionally equivalent to non-GMO feed [for cattle].” While this is specifically referring to cattle, the same can be said about human consumption of GMO foods. Finally, Entine makes a good point that if these foods were as harmful as allegations say, people and animals would be dying off at a huge rate, which has not been found.
In conclusion, GMO foods are a much cheaper and safe alternative to non GMO foods and should not be feared as some critics of these foods have suggested. I have no problem eating GMO foods, and would have no problem feeding my children or pets foods that have been made more resilient to pests or disease.
