The Use of Bisphenol A is the Packaging of Food

Bisphenol A, a compound you may have never heard of, plays a big role in food delivery and packaging market all over the world. Bisphenol A (or just BPA), is a “compound used in the manufacture of polycarbonate plastics and epoxy resins used in food packaging,” in order words it’s a big part in the components that make mass food transport possible, allowing foods from California to be enjoyed in Florida or anywhere in the world. As with a lot of other manmade chemicals that go into food production and distribution, BPA has faced opposition from certain studies that have “proved” BPA to be harmful to humans. This goes against the findings of many other trustworthy studies, and this conflict will be addressed in the contents of this paper.
The first and most prominent source of information regarding food safety is the United States’ Food and Drug Administration. This is a group that is tasked with ensuring that nothing harmful is consumed by Americans. Since there are people who are against BPA, the FDA must be against it right? Actually no, the FDA as approved the use of BPA for decades. That’s right, we have been using BPA in the food distribution industry for the more than 40 years in the United States with extreme adverse effects not obvious (to me at least). One may wonder where these rumors of the danger behind BPA comes from. While almost all notable groups have declared that BPA is perfectly safe for the masses, a few have not come to the same conclusion.
The National Toxicology Program (NTP) is a group who has not found BPA safe for public use for transporting foods. However, they also have not found it harmful in anyway – the NTP concluded that there is not enough data to come to a meaningful conclusion. They said that there “is ‘some concern’ about it,” which is definitely not enough evidence to prove that BPA is a harmful compound that should not be used. Another group that has not come to the same conclusion as the FDA, the regulatory agencies responsible for food safety in Europe, Japan, and Australia, as well as many other groups is the group called Environment Canada. Environment Canada came to the conclusion that BPA was “not a health risk, but took action because there was a decision that the margin between exposure and effects in animals was not great enough.” 
Based on these two conclusions, large media sources begin warning the masses of the danger behind this compound and how it is dangerous to all Americans. These sensationalist reports can bring good ratings as Americans tune in for their own, but can often mislead the public who may not know about the large reputable groups that have cleared the compound to be used like the FDA and the other administrations mentioned above.
In conclusion, misinformation like these rumors of the dangers behind BPA packing and other food related “dangers” can cause problems in the food world. Another example of how a few studies arguing with the mainstream consensus causing large debates is with GMO foods. Even when most large respectable groups decide something is safe, small doubts can really affect how the public thinks on a subject. BPA has been used for over 40 years in the mainstream food packaging business with little if any adverse side effects to most people. And while one large study should not be taken with 100% truth, if the study has been repeated by many different groups with the same conclusion, it is trustworthy and should be listened to.
