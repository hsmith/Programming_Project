What is the Cost of a Good Life?
	In the context of this paper, I will be providing a supported answer to the question of “what is the cost of pursuing material security as the basis of success?” To answer the question, one must first understand what it is asking. In this instance, the cost is referring to a price paid by an individual, or what they have to give up – be it physical or one that cannot be measured. Material security is investing yourself in material items like a new cellphones or new shoes. So to base your success on these material items is to judge the worth of your life on the amount of money you had, the number of cars you owned, or the size of your property. Often times, the price that is paid for these things is giving up ones good life – or peace and enlightenment that people search for. While to most people this seems like the way one should reflect on their lives, Siddhartha and King Midas learned the price one must pay when he or she is focused solely on money and the acquisition of wealth. Siddhartha provides narrative while he is just a wanderer who starves when he cannot find food and also while he is a rich business man who lives in a large house and has a fine wife. King Midas shows a very unfortunate, albeit uncommon, consequence to desiring wealth and goods and from this we can derive the true cost of wanting such items. Both of these narratives provide evidence that there is a price that has to be paid when one forgets about the true meaning that should be associated with life and to pay this price, one must often go through a long journey and learn to give up portions of his or her life.
	King Midas – a name typically associated gold and riches – is the perfect example of how there can be a cost associated with the obsession of material goods and wealth. In the play Metamorphoses, King Midas gives an aside to the audience. While he is giving this aside, Midas’ daughter is playing with a ball in the background and is causing a ruckus. The King occasionally breaks from his aside to demand that she be silence. Despite this aggravation he shows to his daughter, Midas says that family is the most important thing for him – but “not anyone else’s for god’s sake” (Zimmerman). Throughout this aside, it is clear to the audience that Midas is obsessed with only his money and not with his family like he says– he is one who judges his success almost solely on how much money he can make or how much wealth he can accumulate. Through a series of events King Midas is blessed by a gift from Bacchus, the god of wine. Midas gets to choose the gift and his request is to “grant me that everything I touch, everything I put my hand to, will turn to solid gold” (Zimmerman). The King quickly finds out that the golden touch is actually a curse when he turns his own daughter into solid gold. Midas quickly realizes this was a bad idea and he sees the trouble that his obsession has caused. “Take it away, now” (Zimmerman), begs Midas to Bacchus as he realizes that the price he had to pay for being greedy was far too much – the life of his own daughter. The only way for Midas to free his daughter is to go on a long quest and by the end of it, Midas realizes what he was missing - the love for his family - and in this realization he is freed from the shackles of wealth and money.
	The cost for Siddhartha was less severe than the price paid by Midas. Siddhartha, lived the early part of his life as the son of a Brahman and then transitioned into the life of a Samana – essentially a beggar with no material goods who lived off the land. However as the story progresses, Siddhartha falls prey to the curse that money casts at those who divulge themselves too much into its grasps. Due to his love for a woman, Siddhartha begins to learn how to make money as a partner of Kamaswami who is a wealthy business man in the region who makes his profit from trade. At first, Siddhartha sees this life of money as a game and he plays it not necessary looking for a profit but more for just a good time - “he had tasted wealth… yet for a long time he had remained a samana at heart” (Hesse 67). Eventually, this game becomes real for Siddhartha, he gives up his simple and possessionless life for gambling, money, and property. Just like King Midas, Siddhartha based the success of his life on the profit he could make but in this case, the cost that Siddhartha had to pay was that of his own self journey. He had given up his search for enlightenment for something he thought would be eternal – material possession. After many years, Siddhartha realizes that this money filled life is not what he was looking.  Wealth caused him to give up his simple life of a Samana and his search for the good life for most of his adult life, the text says that “the world had captured him… property, ownership, and wealth had… captured him” (Hesse 70). Just like King Midas, after he realizes his mistake of basing his life on money, Siddhartha changes his ways. He leaves his life of wealth and becomes a river boat operator but he can never get back the years he wasted whilst living under the influence of money.
	Siddhartha and King Midas had to pay for their obsession with money. Midas had to give up his own daughter and go on a long journey to get her back because his judgment was shrouded by his love for gold. Siddhartha stopped his search for the good life and enlightenment when money became his number one priority. Prices have to be paid by everyone who seeks to put material goods at the helm of his or her life, whether the cost is a physical one or the cost is having to give up one’s own good life. Fortunately both Siddhartha and King Midas realized the error of their ways and were able to turn back and re-evaluate their lives – but this wasn’t free. It came at the price of time and distress. However, if one does not realize that they are being held captive by money and wealth, he or she may never be able to turn away from these things and will never find the true good life.
