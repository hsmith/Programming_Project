Fighting for the good life.
Fighting for what is right and just in society.
Antigone, along with other readings for these weeks epically Dr. Kings “Letter from a Birmingham Jail,” show the theme of fighting for the good life – or fighting for what is right in one’s mind. In the play Antigone after a civil war leaving both of her brothers dead, Antigone’s uncle Creon takes over control of Thebes. Antigone’s brothers Eteocles and Polynices, were the initiators of the civil war and killed each other. Polynices, being on the side that was against the government was projected by the King as dying dishonorably and as a punishment for rebelling against the leadership of Thebes, his body was left to rot and not be buried. Antigone found this to be a terrible punishment and it was unjust and insulting to her dead brother. She rebelled against what she thought was wrong, like Martian Luther King did, she fought for what she thought was right and just. Antigone was willing to die for what she believed in and what she thought was the right thing to do.  After Antigone is captured the blind prophet Tiresias speaks to Creon. This gives us insight into the mind of the city and the minds of the gods. Tiresias tells Creon that the city is sick of what Creon is doing – killing his own niece and tells him that not burying somebody is against the wishes of the gods. 
The story can be turned around however. Perhaps what Creon was doing is the right and just thing for the city of Thebes. After all, he did inherit a war stricken city that had been poorly managed for years before he was king. What he did was make a law with the goal of reestablishing the power of the leadership by demonstrating that going against the king – like Polynices did – would result in being left to rot and not getting a burial. Once he made the law he could not go against it or that would make the kings position seem weak. He had to fight his own self in making the decision whether to kill his own daughter but maintain a powerful position or show weakness to his people by going against his own decree a tough choice for a ruler who needs to uphold the civil order. He fought this battle until Tiresias showed up and informed him that he was going against the gods – Creon’s laws were against the gods laws – a big no no if you believe in that sort of thing. Creon discredits the prophet but eventually changes his mind and goes to release Antigone only to find she is dead and his son is dead, and his wife is dead – a bad outcome for a man just trying to uphold the integrity of the society. The events that transpired in the play transform Creon from the strong man he was in the beginning into a much more humble person.

Questions:
Upon first reading the play, Antigone was the one who obviously was doing what is right. But while writing up this presentation I started to realize that Creon was also doing what is right by trying to uphold order. However, both characters did things against the rules of authority. Does anybody have any thoughts on who was in the right and who was in the wrong in the narrative?
Pagan (the lady who did the video lectures) talked about how dishonorable it was to leave Polynices body to rot like Creon did. She says that was the worst of offenses. Would you be as offended as Antigone was and be motivated like she was to break the law and seek out justice for her family member?
