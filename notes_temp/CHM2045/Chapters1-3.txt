Atom is composed of proton and neutron, positive and neutrally charged respectively. Neutrons stabilize the nucleus. Electron is far less massive than N and P. The carbon 12 isotope has the mass of 12.000 atomic mass units (AMU). Atomic number = number of protons  
Image(for all intents and purposes, that picture can be represented by [6 C 12.01] 
Atomic weight is the average mass of all elements of this type (Mass1 * abundance1 + Mass2 * abundance2). Can’t change proton number but N count can change, if the P number changes it’s a different element. [2.1.png Calculating %-abundances of two isotopes with given AMU and N number] 
7 Periods 18 Groups. Group 1A are the Alkali Metals, they are very reactive; 2A are Alkaline Earth Metals; 6A Chalcogens; 7A Halogens; 8A Noble Gases 
Molecule is made up of two or more non-metallic elements bound together via covalent bonds. Polyatomic molecule contains more than two nonmetallic atoms. Compound is two different atoms combined together, it is still a molecule. Molecules are made of only nonmetals, ionic compound is made of two ions (one metal and one nonmetal) 
An Ion is an atom or group of atoms that has a net positive or negative charge. Cations have positive charges; anions have a negative charge. It takes energy to remove electrons from atoms. Metal attached to a nonmetal is an Ionic substance. Charges must equal 8. Monatomic ion contains only one atom (Na+, Cl-, Ca2+, O2-. Polyatomic ions contains more than one atom (OH-, CN-) 
Have to know Nomenclature of some Polyatomic Ions from ppt 
Ionic compounds consist of combinations of cations and anions. Covalent substances are molecules – they consist of individual molecules. Ionic substances are formula units. Anion add ide to the element name (BaCl2 barium chloride, Li2O lithium oxide). 
Some metals have multiple ions, so you have to show which one you’re talking about. 
Arrhenius acid is a substance that yields hydrogen ions when dissolved in water. It’s a molecule and contains Hydrogen.  
On the other hand, an Arrhenius base is a substance that yields hydroxide ions when dissolved in water. (NH4OH ammonium hydroxide, NaOH sodium hydroxide, KOH potassium hydroxide) 
On the third hand, an oxoacid is an acid that contains hydrogen, oxygen, and another element. SO4 (not an oxoacid) > H2SO4 (an oxoacid). The hydrogen always attaches to the oxygen. 
“…ate” in anion →  “…ic” in acid   (sulfate ion → sulfuric acid) 
“…ite” in anion →  “…ous” in acid  (nitrite ion → nitrous acid) 
Hydrates are compounds that have some water molecules thrown in there. They use the Greek prefixes (CaSO4•2H20 is calcium sulfate dihydrate)

The Mole (Avogadro’s number). The units of Avogadro’s number are mol or entities/mol. The numerical value of the atomic mass will equal the molar mass in one mol (1 Fe atom has an average atomic mass of 55.85 amu; 1 mole of Fe atoms has a molar mass of 55.85 g/mol). 
*This is missed a lot* Mole ratios: mol1/mol2 (1 mol of H20 has 2 mols of hydrogen in it.) 
How many atoms are in .551g of potassium (k)? 
1 mol K has a mass of 39.10g, 1 mol K contains 6.022x10e23 atoms.  
.0551g*(1mol/39.10g)*(6.022x10e23 atoms/mol) = 8.49*10e21 atoms. 
Molar mass (g/mol) = atomic mass x coefficient. Molecular mass is the sm of the atomic masses in a molecule. Molecular mass = molar mass. 1 mol of SO2 = 64.07 g of SO2. Molar Ratio is the ratio of specific elements to the entire molecule (H20, the 2 is a molar ratio).  
How many mols of H are in 25 grams of H20? 
The molar mass of H20 = 18.02 g/mol 
So there are (25.0g)(1 mol H20 / 18.02g) = 1.39 mol H20 
Then (1.39 mol H20)(2 mol H / 1 mol H20) = 2.78 mol H 
Another way would be (25.0g)(1 mol H20 /18.2g)(2 hol H/1 mol H20) = 2.77 mol H 
Formula Mass is the mass of a compound. 
Percent composition of an element in a compound is the molar mass of the element divided by the molar mass of the compound times 100. 
Molecular formula shows the exact number of atoms vs the empirical formula that is the lowest whole number ratio of atoms in the compound. These two are not always the same. 
Combustion Analysis: When Oxygen reacts with some reactant and forms products.  
CxHyOz + O2 -> CO2 +H2O (all C goes to CO2 and all H goes to H2O) 
Dalton’s Atomic Theory – this leads to the Law of Conservation of Mass. All elements that go into a reaction must come out. (16x + 8y -> 8x2y). A chemical reaction is a process in which one or more substances is changed into one or more new substances. A chemical formula is a way to show a chemical reaction (2H2 + O2 -> 2H2O).  
The limiting reactant is the limiting factor of a reaction. It is which element would run out first when reacting multiple elements. The Theoretical Yield is the amount of product that would result if all the limiting reagent reacted, however in reality, not all of the reagents are used, so the Actual Yield is what you can actually get.

Double unknown problem: a certain grams of two compounds are mixed and they yield some gramage of another compound. What were the individual masses of the original masses?  
C6H6 + C7H8 -> CO2 (29.20g of the reactants and 98.09g of products). Find the molar mass of the CO2. Multiply the molar ratio of C6H6 to CO2 by the molar mass of C6H6 and the unknown (x) grams of C6H6 then add the molar ratio of C7H6 multiplied by the molar mass of C7H6 and 29.20-x grams of C7H6. You get 12.05g of C6H6 and 17.15g of C7H6.
