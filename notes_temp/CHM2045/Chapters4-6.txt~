Precipitation Reactions – removal/combining of ions from solution to form a solid precipitate. 
Acid – Base Reactions (“neutralization”) – transfer of protons from acid to base to form water molecules 
Oxidation – Reduction (“redox”) Reactions – transfer of electrons from reducing agent to oxidizing agent.  
Electrolytes will dissolve into water as ions. Strong ones dissolve more so.  Strong Arrhenius Acids are HCl HBr HI HNO3 H2SO4 HClO4. 
Precipitation:  
Spectator ions are ions that do not participate in the reaction.  
Solubility is a complex matter dealing with enthalpy and entropy. 
Step one, take your reaction, split them all into ions, remove common ions on both sides, and you after left with a net ionic formula. 
Acid Base reactions consist of an acid, a base and they react to form an ionic salt and a water. 
Monoprotic acid is when you have one ioizable proton per molecule. (HCL -> H+ + Cl-) 
Diprotic acids is when you have two ionizable protons per molecule. 
Triprotic acids have three ionizable protons per molecule. 
Tritration is when a solution of accurately known concentration is added to another solution of unknown concentration until the chemical reaction between the two solutions is complete. The Equivalence point is when the reaction is complete.  
What volume of a 1.420 M NaOH solution is required to titrate 25 mL of a 4.5 M H2SO4 solution? 
H2SO4 + 2NaOH -> 2H2O + Na2SO4..025L x (4.5 mol / 1 L) x (2 mols NaOH / 1mol H2SO4) x (1 L / 1.420 mol NaOH) = 158mL 
Oxidation – Reaction with different states of matter. Oxidation number is not a measureable unit, it’s used to assess what’s going on in the reaction. Oxidations reduction reactions involve the transfer of electrons from the reducing agent to the oxidizing agent (usually a metal to a gas). Oxidation numbers are used to track the transfer of electrons. The highest oxidation state of a metal is its group number. For a non-metal, the highest is the group number and the lowest is group # - 8. 
Oxidation reduction reactions (electron transfer reactions). 
Strong reducers in one state are strong oxidizers as the other one. 
Strong reducers are on the left, strong oxidizers are on the right of the periodic table 
Types of reaction-  
Displacement reaction: A + BC -> AC + B 
Hydrogen displacement – metal + water -> hydrogen + metalhydroxide 
Metal displacement – reacting two metals together a highly reactive one to a less reactive one, the higher reactive one will replace the less reactive one 
Halogen displacement –  
The activity series for halogens – F2 > Cl2 > Br2 > I2 (strong oxidizers to weaker) 
Disproportionation reaction – an element is simultaneously oxidized and reduced. 
Precipitation reactions can’t be oxidation ones and vise versa. Acid base cant be oxidation either. 
Alkali and nitrates are soluble.

ΔG = ΔH – TΔS 
Exothermic processes are any process in which thermal energy is transferred from the system to the surroundings. The system is what you are focusing on (a chemical or an item) 
2H2 (g) + O2 (g) -> 2H2O (l) + energy 
H2O (l) -> H2O (s) + energy 
Endothermic processes are any process in which thermal energy has supplied to the system from the surroundings. 
2H2O (l) + energy -> 2H2 (g) + O2 (g)  
Enthalpy change (ΔH) is used to quantify the “heat” (thermal energy transfer) into or out of a system 
ΔH = H (products) – H (reactants) 
ΔH is the heat given off or absorbed during a reaction 
Thermal energy transfer (heat) is in the units joules (J) where J = kg x m2 / s2 (E=MC2). 
Reversing a reaction negates the sign of ΔH (6.01 -> -6.01). If you multiply the equation by some factor, multiply the ΔH too. 
Final Energy State – Initial Energy State = ΔH 
Heat = ΔH = enthalpy = q 
You can find the ΔH of a reaction by adding together the ΔH of containing elements. The standard enthalpy of reaction is the enthalpy of a reaction carried at 1 atm. 
ΔH0rxn = sum ΔH(products) – sum ΔH(reactants). This is called Hess’s Law – the reaction is the same whether it happens in one step or in multiple. 
A negative ΔH would imply the two elements would join together, a positive one implies that they would not normally combine. 
The heat capacity ( C ) of a substance is the amount of heat (q) required to raise the temperature of a given quantity (m) of the substance by one degree Celsius. J/oC or J/K. The specific heat (s) of a substance is the amount of heat (q) required to raise the temperature of one gram of the substance by one degree Celsius. J/gxoC or J/gxK. Low heat capacity means that it doesn’t take much energy to raise the temperature.  
The first law of thermodynamics is don’t talk about thermodynamics. Lelelel
