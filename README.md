##Piano Hero TODO:
-Need a GUI to display the falling notes, score, etc. <br>
-Need a way to play piano with keyboard keys (each key corresponds to a sound file of a specific note). <br>
-Need a way to define a song, eg. a format that we can save songs to and be able to read and display the notes on time. <br>
 * I think that we will have some smallest time segment (1/16th of a second for example), and then we will build the song around that time scale.
 * q,w,e,r,,,,,e,w,q would mean that for the first 1/16th a 'q' would need to be played, then the next beat would be a 'w'. When there are no letters  in between commas, that beat has no notes. Notes that you hold down may be q,q,q,q for example.
 * Multiple notes could be played each beat: qwe,rt,rt,rt,w,w,w,e
 * I just came up with this, so if you have a better implementation we can use that.

-Need a way to keep score and display it. This could also include keeping a high score. <br>
-We will all have to make atleast one song so that we have some kind of library. <br>
